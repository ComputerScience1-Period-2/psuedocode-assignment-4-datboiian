Deal a single card at a time in a clockwise manner to each player; 

Check for a minimum of 2 players;

If all 52 cards are dealt:
   players arrange them into a squared up stack facedown;

All players turn over the top card of their stack and place it on the playing surface in front of them;

The player who played the card with the highest value wins all of the cards played during the hand;
Place the won cards in their own stack; 

If more than one player plays the same card:
   then a "War" is initiated, and the players who played the same card place 3 cards facedown and then play another card to determine the victor of the war;
   
The player who plays the highest value card wins all cards played in the hand;

If the players involved in the war tie again: 
   the war process is repeated until there is a victor;
   
The process of playing a hand (Steps 4 through 8) is repeated until one player possesses all 52 cards of the deck; 

The player who posesses all 52 cards of the deck wins the game;
